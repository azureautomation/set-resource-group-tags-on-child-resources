Set Resource Group Tags On Child Resources
==========================================

            

This Powershell Runbook iterates through the resource groups in a Subscription and copy tags to his child resources.


After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value. Tags enable you to retrieve related resources from different resource groups. This approach is helpful when you need to organize resources for billing
 or management.


The script is based on the following documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/powershell-azure-resource-manager#tag-resources


 


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
